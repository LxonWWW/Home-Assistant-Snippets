### Step 4

Replace all "spotify_YOUR_NAME" in "spotify_listening_history.yaml" and paste it into a new automation.

### Step 5

Create a new dasboard as a panel and subview and paste the following code there:

```
square: false
columns: 1
type: grid
cards:
  - initial_view: dayGridDay
    type: calendar
    entities:
      - calendar.spotify_song_list
    title: HÃ¶rverlauf
```

### Final step

Now trigger the "spotify_track_info" helper via your favourite voice assistant like Google Home, Siri or Alexa.
You will always get a response when something is playing via Spotify. Even if it doesn't play via your smart speaker.
You can always check the song you requested the name of in your calendar.
